# Logic Programming Projects

This repository contains 7 Logic Programming projects completed during the Academic Year 2022-23. Each project is stored in a separate folder, and each folder may contain input files.

## Project 1: Pies Ordering

Description: This project focuses on arranging circular pies of different sizes in a specific order using a spatula. The goal is to arrange the pies in a column, with the larger pies at the bottom and the smallest pie at the top.

Folder: `Project1_Pies_Ordering`

## Project 2: Activity Assignment

Description: In this project, activities and individuals are represented. The task is to assign activities to individuals while considering constraints such as the maximum total time an individual can undertake and the minimum time between successive activities.

Folder: `Project2_Activity_Assignment`

## Project 3: Crossword Solver

Description: This project involves solving a square-shaped crossword puzzle. The dimensions and black positions of the crossword are given, along with a list of words to be placed in the puzzle. The goal is to find a feasible placement of the words in the crossword.

Folder: `Project3_Crossword_Solver`

## Project 4: Number Division

Description: The objective of this project is to divide a set of positive integers into two subsets, ensuring that both subsets have the same number of elements, the sum of elements in each subset is equal, and the sum of squares of elements in each subset is also equal.

Folder: `Project4_Number_Division`

## Project 5: Maximum Satisfiability

Description: This project deals with solving the Maximum Satisfiability (MAXSAT) problem, which involves assigning truth values to propositional symbols in order to maximize the number of true sentences in a given formula in conjunctive normal form (CNF).
